Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains samples that are labeled as either rock or mine. Each sample has multiple features which are used as input to the Logistic Regression model.

Data Source
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Sonar Dataset
Data Description
Features: 60 attributes (sonar signals)
Labels: Binary (Rock or Mine)
Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/elegentpriya/rock-and-mine-logistic-regression.git
cd rock-and-mine-logistic-regression
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Training the Model
To train the Logistic Regression model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Making Predictions
To make predictions using the trained model, use:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv
Model
The logistic regression model is implemented using the scikit-learn library. The training process includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, etc.
Model Training: Training the logistic regression model with the training dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Files
train.py: Script to train the logistic regression model.
predict.py: Script to make predictions using the trained model.
model.pkl: Saved logistic regression model.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: 84%
Example confusion matrix and classification report are also generated to provide more insights into the model's performance.
